============================================================

[Interviewer]
What do you like most about this product?

[Participant]
I like that it is locally roasted. it mean the beans will be fresh and the coffee will be very aromatic.

[Interviewer]
That's great that freshness is so important to you. How do you feel about having coffee delivered to you monthly?

[Participant]
I do not like it. Month is too long, the beans will go stale. I would prefer weekly delivery.

[Interviewer]
What happens when your coffee beans start to go stale - how can you tell?

[Participant]
The coffee does not taste as good.

[Interviewer]
Tell me more about what "not tasting as good" means to you - what do you notice?

[Participant]
It starts to feel a somehow dull, like a cheap instant coffee

[Interviewer]
That's such a vivid way to describe it. When you get freshly roasted beans, what's different about that first cup?

[Participant]
It like I am switched and full of positive energy, ready for the day
