============================================================

[Interviewer]
What do you like most about this product?

[Participant]
I like that it is locally roasted. it mean the beans will be fresh and the coffee will be very aromatic.

[Interviewer]
When you take that first sip, how does the aroma translate into what you actually taste?

[Participant]
It's kind of tangy, slightly bitter 

[Interviewer]
I'm curious - when you're hunting for those fresh beans, what are you actually checking for?

[Participant]
information on the pack. it should have the year of the harvest and the date when it was roasted.

[Interviewer]
After you spot those dates, how do you know the coffee's going to smell as good as you hope?

[Participant]
the pack should have a small hole to smell the beans.

[Interviewer]
What does that first sniff through the little hole tell you about how the cup will actually taste?

[Participant]
it does not tell me exactly how it will taste, but it tells me if the coffee is fresh or been on the shelf for some time.

[Interviewer]
Once you catch that fresh whiff, what do you do next—grab it or keep hunting?

[Participant]
grab it

[Interviewer]
Ever grabbed one that smelled great but later tasted flat—what tipped you off something was off?

[Participant]
no, i have been lucky so far

[Interviewer]
So when you say "fresh," what shelf-time clues are you actually sniffing for?

[Participant]
i do not understand the question

[Interviewer]
Got it—so freshness is more gut feel. When stuff’s limited or “members-only,” does that make you curious or just annoyed?

[Participant]
are you talking about limited editions? I do not pay attention to it. A good coffee is a good coffee.

[Interviewer]
So when you walk past the beans and that first whiff hits—what smell tells you, "Yep, this one's worth taking home"?

[Participant]
yes, exactly

[Interviewer]
And once you get that bag home, how do you know the smell's still holding up day after day?

[Participant]
hmm.. I just brew my coffee next day and see. So far all the coffee I bought was very good.

[Interviewer]
Sounds like you trust your nose more than any date—do you ever check the roast-on stamp anyway?

[Participant]
Yes, of course i do, I said that earlier. This is a must. i just skip anything roasted a week ago or earlier.

[Interviewer]
I'm curious—have you ever thought about a subscription that ships beans just a day or two off the roast?

[Participant]
That would be great. Will save me time.

[Interviewer]
What would you do with the extra time if the beans just showed up?

[Participant]
All the usual things I do. It's just the convenience. Allows me to focus on the coffee, not the logistics. 

[Interviewer]
When you say "focus on the coffee," what part of making or drinking it feels most worth that focus to you?

[Participant]
It's the whole ritual - from opening the bag, getting that smell, then grinding, brewing and to the first sip. Then its just a pure pleasure.

[Interviewer]
Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?
