============================================================

[Interviewer]
What do you like most about this product?

[Participant]
I like that it is locally roasted. it mean the beans will be fresh and the coffee will be very aromatic.

[Interviewer]
That's great that freshness matters to you. How do you feel about having coffee delivered to you monthly?

[Participant]
I do not like it. Month is too long, the beans will go stale. I would prefer weekly delivery.

[Interviewer]
What makes weekly delivery work better for you than monthly?

[Participant]
As i said, the coffee beans will not go stale and will not lose aroma. 

[Interviewer]
How long would you say coffee beans typically stay fresh once you open them?

[Participant]
3-4 days. So i would order couple of packs to be delivered each week.

[Interviewer]
That's interesting - so if you're thinking weekly deliveries work best for freshness, what would monthly delivery mean for your coffee routine?

[Participant]
It will not work, i will then keep doing what i do now, just buy a couple of bags of beans in a supermarket every week.

[Interviewer]
Got it - so monthly just wouldn't fit how you like to drink your coffee. What is it about that weekly routine that works so well for you?

[Participant]
beans stay fresh

[Interviewer]
That makes sense about freshness being key. What would need to be different about a monthly delivery to make it work for someone like you?

[Participant]
maybe a vacuum packaging which is sealed right after roasting. in that way the beans will stay fresh for longer.

[Interviewer]
That's a smart solution with the vacuum packaging. How often do you think you'd want those deliveries coming to your door?

[Participant]
if it is a vacuum pack, then monthly should work.

[Interviewer]
What makes monthly timing feel right for you?

[Participant]
Vacuum pack that keeps the beans fresh

[Interviewer]
That makes sense - how do you usually go through a month's worth of coffee beans?

[Participant]
i do not understand the question

[Interviewer]
Let me ask it differently - how often do you find yourself buying coffee beans?

[Participant]
currently, as i said earlier, i buy 2 packs every week 

[Interviewer]
Is there anything else you'd like to share before we wrap up?
