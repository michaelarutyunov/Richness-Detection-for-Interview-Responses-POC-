# Richness Scoring
richness_scoring:
  formula: "sum(node_weights) + sum(edge_boosts)"
  thresholds:
    shallow: 0.5
    moderate: 2.0
    rich: 5.0

# Node Types
node_types:
  - name: "attribute"
    description: "Concrete, observable product features (taste, price, packaging, size)"
    richness_weight: 0.5
    probing_prompt: "What specifically about {node} matters to you?"
    llm_extraction_prompt: |
      Extract concrete product attributes the participant mentioned.
      Look for: price, taste, size, packaging, color, smell, texture, brand.
      Examples:
      - "costs too much" → price_too_high
      - "nice flavor" → pleasant_taste
      - "easy to open" → convenient_packaging
    validation_regex: "^[a-z_]{3,40}$"

  - name: "functional_consequence"
    description: "Direct, tangible outcomes from using the product (saves time, reduces mess, lasts longer)"
    richness_weight: 1.0
    probing_prompt: "How does {node} affect your daily routine?"
    llm_extraction_prompt: |
      Extract functional consequences - practical effects of product features.
      Look for: time-saving, convenience, performance, durability, efficiency.
      Examples:
      - "saves me time in the morning" → time_saving
      - "keeps fresh longer" → extended_freshness
      - "doesn't spill" → mess_prevention
    validation_regex: "^[a-z_]{3,40}$"

  - name: "psychosocial_consequence"
    description: "Personal/social meanings and feelings (feel competent, look good to others, feel modern)"
    richness_weight: 1.5
    probing_prompt: "What does {node} say about you or how you feel?"
    llm_extraction_prompt: |
      Extract psychosocial consequences - emotional and social impacts.
      Look for: self-perception, social image, emotional states, identity.
      Examples:
      - "makes me feel like a good parent" → positive_self_image
      - "people notice it's premium" → social_status
      - "less stressed" → reduced_anxiety
    validation_regex: "^[a-z_]{3,40}$"

    description: "End goals and core values (security, belonging, self-esteem, family wellbeing)"
    richness_weight: 2.0
    probing_prompt: "Why is {node} important to your life overall?"
    llm_extraction_prompt: |
      Extract terminal values - fundamental life goals.
      Look for: security, belonging, achievement, family, health, freedom.
      Examples:
      - "important for my family's health" → family_wellbeing
      - "gives me peace of mind" → security
      - "helps me be myself" → authenticity
    validation_regex: "^[a-z_]{3,40}$"

    richness_boost: 1.0  # Linking up the chain is key insight

  - name: "blocks"
    description: "A prevents or hinders achieving B"
    valid_sources: ["attribute", "functional_consequence"]
    valid_targets: ["psychosocial_consequence", "value"]
    richness_boost: 2.0  # Reveals deep barriers - very valuable

# Seed Nodes (starting concepts to ensure coverage)
seed_nodes:
  - name: "price_point"
    type: "attribute"
    label: "price"
    introduction_prompt: "Let's talk about price. What are your thoughts on the pricing of this product?"

  - name: "convenience"
    type: "value"
    label: "convenience_value"
    introduction_prompt: "How important is convenience in your daily life when it comes to products like this?"

# Metadata
schema_description: |
  Means-End Chain lens for consumer mental models.
  Models consumer thinking as a vertical ladder of abstraction:
  Attributes → Functional Consequences → Psychosocial Consequences → Values

  Best for: Understanding WHY consumers value certain product features,
  uncovering motivational drivers, and positioning/messaging strategy.
