  node_types:
    attribute:
      name: "attribute"
      description: "Concrete observable product features"
      is_terminal: false
      llm_prompt: |
        Observable product features that can be verified WITHOUT using the product.

        **Physical & Composition Attributes** (objective, measurable):
        - Composition: contains caffeine, made of leather, organic ingredients
        - Packaging: bottle size, shape, material, labeling
        - Physical properties: weight, volume, temperature

        **Sensory Attributes** (observable through senses):
        - Basic appearance: color, clarity, foam presence
        - Basic texture: observed consistency (thick vs thin)

        **NOT attributes** (these require USE → they are consequences):
        - Sensory EXPERIENCES: "creamy mouthfeel", "pleasant sensation"
        - Performance: "easy to mix", "keeps drinks cold"
        - Perceptual interpretations: "appears premium", "looks appetizing"

        **Boundary cases** - If sensory property involves subjective interpretation,
        classify as functional_consequence, not attribute.
      examples:
        - "blue color"
        - "500ml volume"
        - "smooth texture"
        - "contains caffeine"
        - "thick creamy consistency"
        - "proper foam"

    functional_consequence:
      name: "functional_consequence"
      description: "Direct, tangible outcomes from using the product"
      is_terminal: false
      llm_prompt: |
        Direct result of an attribute during use. What happens BECAUSE of the attribute.

        **Functional consequences describe PERFORMANCE and OUTCOMES:**
        - Usability: "easy to mix", "hard to pour", "convenient to carry"
        - Performance: "keeps drinks cold for 6 hours", "charges in 30 minutes", "lasts all day"
        - Physical effects: "fills me up", "wakes me up", "quenches thirst"
        - Fit/compatibility: "fits in car cupholder", "works with my coffee machine"

        **Examples of attribute → functional consequence:**
        - "watery texture" (attribute) → "hard to mix properly" (functional)
        - "thin consistency" (attribute) → "gets lost in coffee" (functional)
        - "no foam" (attribute) → "coffee looks diluted" (functional)
        - "thick creamy texture" (attribute) → "creates satisfying mouthfeel" (functional)

        **Decision test:** Does it describe an outcome or performance result from using the product?
        - YES = functional consequence
        - NO, it's observable without use = attribute
        - NO, it's about feelings/identity = psychosocial consequence

        **NOT functional consequences:**
        - Sensory observations: "thick", "creamy", "foamy" (these are attributes)
        - Feelings: "feel confident", "feel premium" (these are psychosocial)
        - Values: "security", "freedom" (these are values)
      examples:
        - "keeps drinks cold for 6 hours"
        - "charges in 30 minutes"
        - "fits in car cupholder"
        - "easy to mix into coffee"
        - "creates stable foam"

    psychosocial_consequence:
      name: "psychosocial_consequence"
      description: "Personal/social meanings and feelings"
      is_terminal: false
      llm_prompt: |
        Personal feelings, self-perceptions, or social meanings derived from product use.
        Examples: 'feel more organized', 'appears professional', 'reduces anxiety', 'feel trendy', 'gain respect from peers'
        Focus: psychological states, emotions, social identity, or how others perceive you.
        NOT: end-state values or functional outcomes - this is about intermediate feelings/meanings.
      examples:
        - "feel more organized"
        - "appears professional"
        - "reduces anxiety"

    value:
      name: "value"
      description: "End goals and core values"
      is_terminal: true
      llm_prompt: |
        Core personal values or life themes that matter beyond this specific product.

        **Terminal values** (universally meaningful):
        - security, freedom, belonging, achievement, harmony

        **Everyday wellbeing values** (broader life themes):
        - "starting the day right", "being productive", "feeling in control"
        - "maintaining wellness", "enjoying small pleasures", "peace of mind"

        If a psychosocial consequence relates to broader life goals or daily wellbeing,
        promote to value with a LOWER threshold than universal ideals.

        Examples:
        - "feel confident" → psychosocial
        - "confidence in social situations" → value (relates to belonging/social harmony)
        - "pleasant morning routine" → value (relates to wellbeing)
      examples:
        - "security"
        - "family harmony"
        - "self-actualization"
        - "personal freedom"

  edge_types:
    - name: "leads_to"
      description: "A causes or enables B vertically"
      valid_sources: ["attribute", "functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence"]
      valid_targets: ["functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence", "value"]
      llm_prompt: |
        Direct causal relationship moving UP the means-end chain (from concrete to abstract).
        Use when: A directly causes, results in, or enables B at the next level.
        Examples:
        - 'smooth texture' → 'comfortable to hold' (attribute → functional)
        - 'charges quickly' → 'reduces waiting anxiety' (functional → psychosocial)
        - 'feel confident' → 'self-actualization' (psychosocial → value)
        Must connect adjacent levels in hierarchy. NOT for lateral relationships.

    - name: "requires"
      description: "B cannot exist without A (prerequisite)"
      valid_sources: ["attribute", "functional_consequence"]
      valid_targets: ["functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence"]
      llm_prompt: |
        Hard dependency where B is impossible without A (stronger than enables).
        Examples:
        - 'has battery' → requires → 'wireless operation'
        - 'waterproof seal' → requires → 'use in rain'
        Use sparingly - only for true prerequisites, not just helpful factors.

    - name: "conflicts_with"
      description: "A and B are mutually incompatible"
      valid_sources: ["attribute", "functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence"]
      valid_targets: ["attribute", "functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence"]
      llm_prompt: |
        Inherent incompatibility or trade-off where BOTH CANNOT BE TRUE simultaneously.

        CORRECT usage (mutual exclusivity):
        - 'large capacity' ↔ 'portable' (can't maximize both)
        - 'premium materials' ↔ 'affordable' (can't have both)
        - 'feel exclusive' ↔ 'feel accessible' (contradictory feelings)

        INCORRECT usage (these are NOT conflicts):
        - "X doesn't work, so I need Y" → This is leads_to, NOT conflicts_with
          The inadequacy of X leads to needing Y. X and Y can both be true.
        - "Water doesn't smooth coffee, so I need something else"
          → water_doesnt_smooth -leads_to-> need_something_that_smooths

        Test: Can A and B both be true at the same time? If yes, it's NOT a conflict.

    - name: "relates_to"
      description: "A has some stated relationship to B (catch-all for ambiguous relationships)"
      valid_sources: ["attribute", "functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence", "value"]
      valid_targets: ["attribute", "functional_consequence", "psychosocial_consequence", "value"]
      llm_prompt: |
        Any relationship that doesn't fit leads_to/requires/conflicts_with but respondent clearly links A and B.
        Always preserve exact quote. Examples:
        - Comparisons: "I prefer instant coffee [to premium]"
        - Associations: "reminds me of X"
        - Tensions: "expensive but probably worth it"
        - Conditionals: "only if I have time"
        Use this when relationship is stated but mechanism unclear.

  extraction_guidance: |
    When classifying nodes, consider the level of abstraction:
    - Attributes are observable product features
    - Functional consequences are practical "what it does"
    - Psychosocial consequences involve self-perception or social dynamics
    - Values are abstract end-states people pursue across life domains

    CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY - When uncertain between levels, choose the HIGHER level if the respondent expresses:
    - Personal meaning or subjective interpretation
    - Emotional reaction or feeling
    - Social significance or identity

    Choose the LOWER level only if the statement is:
    - Purely observational without interpretation
    - Factual description without personal meaning

    The goal is to build a ladder from concrete (attributes) to abstract (values),
    revealing the personal meaning structure behind product perceptions.

    EDGE TYPE SELECTION - CRITICAL:
    - "X doesn't work, so I need Y" = CAUSAL CHAIN (leads_to), not conflict
    - conflicts_with ONLY when A and B cannot both be true/achieved
    - When in doubt between leads_to and conflicts_with, use leads_to

  coverage_guidance: |
    RTB (Reason to Believe) and Promise elements can be satisfied by ANY node type,
    not just attributes.

    Coverage is satisfied when the respondent provides ANY meaningful reaction about
    the reference element, including:
    - Attribute observation ("it's thick")
    - Functional interpretation ("makes it mix better")
    - Psychosocial reaction ("I trust natural processes")
    - Skepticism or curiosity ("I don't know what enzymes are")

    The node_type does NOT need to match the element category.
