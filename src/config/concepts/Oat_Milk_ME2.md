# Name
"Oat Milk (for means-end chaining)"

# Description
"Switching to plant-based was easy for you — but your family noticed. The kids complained about the taste, your partner missed their Sunday cappuccinos. You wanted to make a choice that felt responsible, but not at the cost of those small moments together. This oat milk brings them back. Naturally creamy, froths properly — because it's made with an enzyme process that respects both the oats and the ritual. Now you can care for your family and your values, not choose between them."
