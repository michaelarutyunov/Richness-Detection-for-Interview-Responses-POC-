# Name
"Oat Milk (for means-end chaining)"

# Description
"You switched to plant-based milk because it felt right — better for you, better for the planet. But the thin, watery taste made every cup feel like a compromise, like you were settling. This oat milk is different. It's naturally creamy and froths like dairy, made using an enzyme process that unlocks what's already in Scandinavian oats. No thickeners, no workarounds — just milk that lets you be yourself, not a compromised version."
