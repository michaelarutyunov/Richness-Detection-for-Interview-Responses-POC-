# Name
"Oat Milk"

# Description
"You've tried switching to plant-based milk, but they always taste thin and disappear into your coffee. This oat milk is different — naturally creamy and froths properly, because it's made using an enzyme process that unlocks the creaminess of Scandinavian oats without adding thickeners. Finally, a dairy alternative that doesn't ask you to compromise."
