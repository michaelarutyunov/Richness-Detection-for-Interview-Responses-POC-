"Home Rental"

# Description
"Hotels can feel the same wherever you go—generic rooms, tourist-trap recommendations, no real connection to the place you're visiting. Imagine instead staying in a real home, hosted by someone who actually lives there and can point you to the neighbourhood spots only locals know. That's how travel starts to feel like living somewhere, not just passing through."
