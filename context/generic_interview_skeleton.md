# Core logic:
Understand context → Capture gut reaction → Explore meaning → Co-create improvements → Assess potential.

# 1. Warm-Up & Context Setting
Goal: Build rapport and understand the consumer’s real-world behavior in the category.

Category habits: “Walk me through the last time you bought/used [category].”
Current needs & frustrations: “What do you love or hate about the options available today?”
Decision drivers: “What matters most to you when choosing a [product/service]?”
Why? Grounds the concept in the participant’s lived experience—so feedback isn’t abstract. 

# 2. First Impressions (Unaided Reaction)
Goal: Capture spontaneous, emotional, and intuitive responses before probing.

Present the concept (e.g., description, visual, prototype, ad mock-up).
Ask open-ended, non-leading questions:
“What’s your initial reaction?”
“What stands out to you?”
“What do you think this is trying to do or solve?”
Why? Avoids anchoring bias—you see what naturally resonates or confuses them. 

# 3. Deep Dive: Comprehension, Relevance & Appeal
Goal: Explore understanding, personal relevance, and perceived value.

Comprehension: “In your own words, what is this offering?”
Relevance: “Is this something you’d consider for yourself? Why or why not?”
Benefits & barriers:
“What’s most appealing about this?”
“What concerns or doubts come to mind?”
Differentiation: “How is this similar to or different from what you use now?”
Tip: Use projective techniques (e.g., “If this product were a person, who would it be?”) to uncover emotional associations. 

# 4. Refinement & Co-Creation
Goal: Identify how to improve the concept and uncover unmet needs.

“If you could change one thing to make this perfect for you, what would it be?”
“What’s missing?”
“Would you pay more for this? What would feel like a fair price?” (if applicable)
“What would convince you to try it?”
Why? Turns feedback into actionable innovation directions. 

# 5. Wrap-Up & Prioritization
Goal: Gauge overall potential and compare (if multiple concepts).

“On a scale of 1–10, how likely would you be to try/buy this? Why that number?”
(If testing multiple concepts): “Which one stands out most? Why?”
Final thoughts: “Is there anything we haven’t covered that’s important to you about this idea?”
Key Principles Across All Stages:
Avoid leading questions (e.g., don’t say “Don’t you love how convenient this is?”).
Probe the ‘why’ behind every statement (“What makes you say that?”).
Use the participant’s language when reflecting back or summarizing.
Stay neutral—your role is to explore, not sell the concept.
Does It Differ From Test to Test?
Yes—but usually within this framework. For example:

# Other enhancements:
A food product concept test might include a sensory tasting phase after Stage 2.
A digital service concept might involve a clickable prototype walkthrough.
A sustainability-focused concept may dive deeper into values alignment in Stage 3.
